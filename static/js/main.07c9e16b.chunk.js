Though     their forces may be battered and initially with limited resources, Duty     sustains their eternal zeal and restoration imperative. While Eisenberg     rebuilds and extracts their Battle Barge The Aegis of Iron from the ruins     of the space hulk, much of the command of the Revenant Crusade in     Caldraeus has been delegated to Marshal Reinhardt von Rosenherz to     persecute a ruthless cleansing campaign upon this unclean sector of     warp-tainted space."},{id:"plaguefester-warband",name:"The Plaguefester Warband",subhead:"Death Guard",src:it,description:"The Plaguefester Warband hails from the bowels of the Warp,     Nurgle\u2019s servant Astartes dedicated to the spreading of putrid plague     and maladies.

An introduction of     corrupted genetic information arriving with one prisoner shipment, and a     few charismatic acolytes to go with it, quickly led to a revolution in     020.M42 that saw the Cult dominate the sparsely-populated system.

The Warp is now shifting once     more, and soon the broader Imperium will want to make contact with their     long-separated territory and collect the Imperial tithe owed in arrears.
